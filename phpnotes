What is PHP:
PHP is a server scripting language, and a powerful tool for making dynamic and interactive Web pages.
PHP is a widely-used, free, and efficient alternative to competitors such as Microsoft's ASP.

What is Variables:
Variables are "containers" for storing information.
a variable starts with the $ sign, followed by the name of the variable.
A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume).

Rules for PHP variables:

A variable starts with the $ sign, followed by the name of the variable
A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
A variable name cannot start with a number
A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
Variable names are case-sensitive ($age and $AGE are two different variables)

Example:
<?php
$x=4;
echo $x;
echo "the value of x is $x";
?>

<?php
$x = 5;
$y = 4;
echo $x + $y;
?>
