What is PHP:
PHP is a server scripting language, and a powerful tool for making dynamic and interactive Web pages.
PHP is a widely-used, free, and efficient alternative to competitors such as Microsoft's ASP.

What is Variables:
Variables are "containers" for storing information.
a variable starts with the $ sign, followed by the name of the variable.
A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume).

Rules for PHP variables:

A variable starts with the $ sign, followed by the name of the variable
A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
A variable name cannot start with a number
A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
Variable names are case-sensitive ($age and $AGE are two different variables)

Example:
<?php
$x=4;
echo $x;
echo "the value of x is $x";
?>


<?php
$x = 5;
$y = 4;
echo $x + $y;
?>

The scope of a variable is the part of the script where the variable can be referenced/used.
PHP has three different variable scopes:

1.local:A variable declared outside a function has a GLOBAL SCOPE and can only be accessed outside a function:
<?php
$x = 5; // global scope

function myTest() {
  // using x inside this function will generate an error
  echo "<p>Variable x inside function is: $x</p>";
}
myTest();

echo "<p>Variable x outside function is: $x</p>";
?>

2.global:
A variable declared within a function has a LOCAL SCOPE and can only be accessed within that function:

Example
<?php
function myTest() {
  $x = 5; // local scope
  echo "<p>Variable x inside function is: $x</p>";
}
myTest();

// using x outside the function will generate an error
echo "<p>Variable x outside function is: $x</p>";
?>
The global keyword is used to access a global variable from within a function.
<?php
$x = 5;
$y = 10;

function myTest() {
  global $x, $y;
  $y = $x + $y;
}

myTest();
echo $y; // outputs 15
?>

3.static:when a function is completed/executed, all of its variables are deleted. However, sometimes we want a local variable NOT to be deleted.
<?php
function myTest() {
  static $x = 0;
  echo $x;
  $x++;
}

myTest();
myTest();
myTest();
?>

Echo and Print:
The echo statement can be used with or without parentheses: echo or echo().
<?php
echo "<h2>PHP is Fun!</h2>";
echo "Hello world!<br>";
echo "I'm about to learn PHP!<br>";
echo "This ", "string ", "was ", "made ", "with multiple parameters.";
?>

The print statement can be used with or without parentheses: print or print().
<?php
print "<h2>PHP is Fun!</h2>";
print "Hello world!<br>";
print "I'm about to learn PHP!";
?>



Data Types
Variables can store data of different types, and different data types can do different things.

PHP supports the following data types:

String
Integer
Float (floating point numbers - also called double)
Boolean
Array
Object
NULL
Resource

Var_dum tell the name of the datatype we r using

<?php
$x = 5985;
var_dump($x);
?>
